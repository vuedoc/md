## Before Submitting an Issue
Check that [our issue database](https://gitlab.com/vuedoc/md/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
Please file a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not file combo 
issues. Please do not submit multiple comments on a single issue - write your 
issue with all the environmental information and reproduction steps so that an 
engineer can reproduce it.

The community wants to help you find a solution to your problem, but every 
problem is unique. In order for an engineer to help resolve your issue, they 
need to be able to reproduce it. We put the product through extensive manual 
and automated QA for every release, and verify all of its functionality. Any 
feature that was previously working in a release that is no longer working is 
marked as a severity/blocker for immediate review.

This means that if you are encountering an error, it is likely due to a unique 
configuration of your system. Reproducing your specific error may require 
significant information about your system and environment. Help us in advance 
by providing a complete assessment of your system and the steps necessary to 
reproduce the issue.

Therefore:
* The details of your environment including OS version, NodeJS version.
* Provide reproducible steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you 
would have expected.
* A detailed description of the behavior that you expect.
